            <p>Can gaining weight be healthy?
                For some people, gaining weight or adding muscle can be just as difficult as losing weight is for others. However, simply adding certain foods to your diet can make your weight gain efforts both healthy and more effective</h2>
                <h2>Here are some of the best foods to help you gain weight or add muscle, the healthy & safely</h2>
            <br>
            <h3> Milk
            </h3> <p class="text-danger">Milk has been used as a weight gainer or muscle builder for decades. For those trying to add more muscle, milk is an excellent protein source that provides both casein and whey proteins. Research has even shown it can help you add muscle when combined with weightlifting </p>
            <h3>Rice</h3>
            <p class="text-info">However, quality carbohydrates from foods like rice can support bulking efforts a few different ways. Higher carb intake typically supports more glycogen storage in muscles, which helps fuel your workouts . In addition, carbs promote an insulin response, which is beneficial to weight gain</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Nuts and nut butter</h3>
            <p class="text-source">Nuts are high in calories. This is because a large part of them is fat, which is a concentrated source of energy. One gram of fat contains 9 calories, while one gram of carbs or protein contains just 4 calories</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Other starches</h3>
            <p class="text-warning"> Potatoes and other starchy foods are a very easy and cost-effective way to add in extra calories. Starchy foods are our main source of carbohydrate and have an important role in a healthy diet. Starchy foods  such as potatoes, bread, rice,  and cereals </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Protein supplements</h3>
            <p class="text-primary">Taking protein supplements is a common strategy for athletes and bodybuilders who want to gain weight. There are many types available, including whey, soy, egg, and pea protein </p>
            <h3>Cheese</h3>
            <p class="text-secondary">Like dark chocolate, it’s high in calories and fats. Just 1 ounce of cheddar cheese (28 grams) has 110 calories and 7 grams of protein (28Trusted Source). One ounce is smaller than you might think. It’s about the size of a pair of dice. </p>
            <h3>Whole eggs</h3>
            <p class="text-success">Eggs are one of the healthiest muscle-building foods on the planet. They provide a great combination of high quality proteins and healthy fats. Each large raw egg weighing 2 ounces, with shell (50 grams), has about 74 calories</p>
