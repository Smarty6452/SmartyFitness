            <p>One of the most important benefits of bodyweight exercise is its ability to improve your cardiovascular endurance and muscle strength all at once. You get a cardio workout from changing positions and elevating your heart rate, while your bodyweight and gravity work together to help you build muscle</h2>
                <h2>The ‘Big 5’ Basic Bodyweight Moves Are All You Need To Hit Every Muscle</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Planks 
            </h3> <p class="text-danger">The plank is an exercise that uses your own bodyweight. It specifically trains your abs and core muscles. In a plank, get on all fours with your forearms on the mat parallel to each other. Your fingers are pointing slightly inward; stretch your legs out straight behind you.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Pushups</h3>
            <p class="text-info">Push-ups became the unofficial workout move of quarantine, thanks in large part to the fact that they pack a whole lot of bang for your buck. At their core (pardon the nerdy fitness pun), push-ups are really just moving planks, which means they'll give you the same benefits as the static version of the move while also hitting your upper body harder. As you become more advanced, you can try different push-up variations that will help fire up even more muscles in your arms and shoulders.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Squats</h3>
            <p class="text-source">Traditional squats hit every muscle from your waist to your toes, and mastering their perfect form requires you to stay focused and brace your core for the entirety of the move. To do them properly, trainer Peter Tucci suggests keeping the mantra "lift, tuck, lower" at the top of your mind, which will help remind you to keep your chest up, tuck your pelvis in, and lower your butt to a 90-degree angle from your knees</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Pullups</h3>
            <p class="text-warning">A pullup is an upper body strength training exercise. To perform a pullup, you start by hanging onto a pullup bar with your palms facing away from you and your body extended fully. You then pull yourself up until your chin is above the bar. ... The pullup is considered an advanced exercise</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Dip</h3>
            <p class="text-primary">The dip is a compound, bodyweight exercise.
                You grab two parallel bars, hoist yourself up, and then lower your entire body by bending your elbows. When you hear “compound exercise,” it's referring to multi-joint movements that work several muscles or muscle groups at the same time</p>
